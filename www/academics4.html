        <p id="pgh">Keeping up with your grades while in school is a very stressful thing to do. Suppose after a hard test you receive a grade that you are not comfortable with and you want to find ways that can boost your overall grade. 
           There are many approaches that you can take some of which include doing extra credit, taking more time to study material and even as simple as doing your homework. Even if you do not get points for doing your homework you will later realize the benefits of doing it when it comes to little quizzes or big tests that do count.</p>
