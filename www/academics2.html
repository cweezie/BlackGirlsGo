            <p id="pgh">As a teenager, we are always busy, so make sure to have a calendar or planner to organize yourself. It could be a Google Calendar, plan book, planning app, or any other method that works for you. You should always have a database to refer to. Make sure to keep all of your school work in the exclusive binder or folder for that class. Use dividers to separate your homework from classwork and classwork from completed tests/quizzes. Don't forget to carry pencil cases loaded with pens, pencils, sharpener and any other materials you feel are beneficial to your learning. In your locker, use a locker shelf to keep your things easily accessible. When moving between classes, if you need to stop and quickly pick something up, you won't have to dig for it and as a cause be late to your next class.</p>
