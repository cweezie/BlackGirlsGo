        <p id="pgh">Work ethic is important to have in everyday life, it is good to use in school, at work,
        and even at home when doing chores. Work ethic is important to have especially if you want to get
        a good job. Work ethics are characteristics of hard work that many jobs look for when trying to 
        hire someone new. If you have these important characteristics you will get better grades,  a good 
        job, and even more just from being a hard worker. No matter how important work ethic is many people
        do not have it. Work ethics are also skills to have even if you do not have a job or go to school.
        Do not be lazy with your work and give 100 percent.</p>
