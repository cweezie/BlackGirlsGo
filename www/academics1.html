        <p id="pgh"> Time management is a very important aspect of everyone's academic life. Here are some 
        suggestions on how to use your time wisely. When assigned a project you should first look at the 
        due date and then plan what part of the project you are going to do each day up to the due date.
        So make a schedule or an outline of what you are going to work on and when you are going to work 
        on that. When studying for a test or quiz you should not cram because you cannot retain the 
        information that way. Depending on the material and how well you comprehend the information you 
        should start studying about 5-7 days before the test. The amount of studying you do each day 
        depends on how far ahead you study. If Sierra starts studying a week in advances he might only 
        study for 40 minutes each day. However, if Tiana starts studying 3 days in advance she might study
        for about an hour and a half each day.
