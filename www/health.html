        <p id="pgh"> Time management is a very important aspect of everyone's academic life. Here are some 
        suggestions on how to use your time wisely. When assigned a project you should first look at the 
        due date and then plan what part of the project you are going to do each day up to the due date.
        So make a schedule or an outline of what you are going to work on and when you are going to work 
        on that. When studying for a test or quiz you should not cram because you cannot retain the 
        information that way. Depending on the material and how well you comprehend the information you 
        should start studying about 5-7 days before the test. The amount of studying you do each day 
        depends on how far ahead you study. If Sierra starts studying a week in advances he might only 
        study for 40 minutes each day. However, if Tiana starts studying 3 days in advance she might study
        for about an hour and a half each day.

            <p id="pgh">As a teenager, we are always busy, so make sure to have a calendar or planner to 
            organize yourself. It could be a Google Calendar, plan book, planning app, or any other method
            that works for you. You should always have a database to refer to. Make sure to keep all 
            of your school work in the exclusive binder or folder for that class. Use dividers to 
            separate your homework from classwork and classwork from completed tests/ quizzes. 
            Don't forget to carry pencil cases loaded with pencils, pens, colored pencils, 
            sharpener, white out, and any other materials you feel are beneficial to your learning. 
            In your locker, use a locker shelf to keep your things easily accessible. When moving between 
            classes, if you need to stop and quickly pick something up, you won't have to dig for it and 
            as a cause be late to your next class. Use magnets to hang notes or reminders about tests, 
            quizzes, dues dates, or after school activities.</p>

        <p id="pgh">Work ethic is important to have in everyday life, it is good to use in school, at work,
        and even at home when doing chores. Work ethic is important to have especially if you want to get
        a good job. Work ethics are characteristics of hard work that many jobs look for when trying to 
        hire someone new. If you have these important characteristics you will get better grades,  a good 
        job, and even more just from being a hard worker. No matter how important work ethic is many people
        do not have it. Work ethics are also skills to have even if you do not have a job or go to school.
        Do not be lazy with your work and give 100 percent.</p>

        <h3 id="titles2">Example:</h3>
        <p id="pgh">Keeping up with your grades while in school is a very stressful thing to do. Suppose after a hard test you receive a grade that you are not comfortable with and you want to find ways that can boost your overall grade. 
           There are many approaches that you can take some of which include doing extra credit, taking more time to study material and even as simple as doing your homework. Even if you do not get points for doing your homework you will later realize the benefits of doing it when it comes to little quizzes or big tests that do count.</p>
